# Cloud Cost Analyzer Agent

## Problem statement

Cloud cost often spirals due to underutilized resources, lack of automated cleanup and poor visibility. We need an agent that:

- Identifies underutilized resources
- Understands user queries (e.g, "why is the GCP bill high this month")
- Runs actual gcloud CLI commands using an authenticated MCP tool 
- summarizes findings and suggests actions
